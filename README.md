# Rebbit
Rebbit is a Reddit style Discussion Forum website

## Project Proposal
Rebbit is a Canadian social news collection, content rating, and discussion website. Content is divided into subrebbits, where each subrebbit is a collection of logically related posts. Registered users can create and follow subrebbits, create posts, comment on posts, and vote up or down on both posts and comments. Unregistered users are limited to viewing posts and comments. Rebbit presents different views of the website depending on user type. Registered users have access to different functionality that will be presented within the navigation bar after logged in. Administrators also have different functionality that regular registered users will not. These capabilities for administrators will be presented within the navigation bar, but will not for all other user types. Unregistered users will be presented with the view to log in within the navigation bar or on comments. Rebbit users are given the capability to customize their profile and subrebbits that they own. Rebbit provides a platform for users to interact with posts and discussions through a comment and content rating system available to registered users.
